###Crystals Collector Game

This game starts with a random numerical value and four crystals, each with a hidden value. 
With each click of a crystal, its value is added to the user's score.
The goal is to match the score with the given value. 
When the user's score equals the given value, they win and the game resets with new values to match and for the crystals. 
If the user's score goes over the given number, they lose and the game resets with new values.
